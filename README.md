The Doom Fire effect made in c with opengl.

This code is a directly implementation of [DoomFireJS](https://github.com/lpg2709/DoomFireJS). Both is baseade on the algorithim described in [How DOOM fire was done](https://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/).

If you want to better understand how DOOM was designed, read [Game Engine Black Book DOOM](https://fabiensanglard.net/gebbdoom/), I highly recommend it.

## Issues

- The implementations have glitches, like black sparks on the bottom of the fire. (Under investigation)

## Dependences

- [Freeglut](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/)

If you use Windows, I recommend use [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) to compile the code in unix-like environment.
